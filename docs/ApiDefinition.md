# API Definition

## Errors in responses

An error in a response contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | string | a unique code that identifies the error.
| `summary` | string | A description of the function that generated the error
| `detail` | string | The error message.

The code describes both the summary and the detail. The code looks like

``` text
E<number>-<string>
```

The number identifies the summary, the string refers to the detail.

There are a few generic errors that can occur with any query. These errors won't
be repeated in the descriptions below.

| Code | Description |
| --- |  --- |
| `E<n>-INTERNAL` | This is an unknown error. If this occurs, create a bug report.
| `E<n>-DATABASE` | The database becomes unavailable. If the database is unavailable at startup, the server won't start. So this has a different reason. Contact your system administrator. Typically a table or record is locked. |

The server side may discover new errors over time. If a new error is detected an
unknown error is raised. This error can be recognized by the code: the string
portion will be `INTERNAL`. Time to create an error report.

## Labels

Labels are identifiers that are linked to items. The link is done in the UI. The
idea behind the labels is that different types of labels can used: bar codes, QR
codes, and perhaps even covers of containers.

Currently, only *automatic* labels are supported. These are labels that are
generated by the system and proposed to the user. To facilitate this the front
end manages a cache of labels.

### `PUT /labels`

This REST call locks a set of calls of automatic labels. The frontend maintains
a cache of automatic labels through this call

#### Parameters

N/A

#### Request body

* `count`: the number of labels to lock and return.

##### Example

```json
{
    "count": 10
}
```

#### Response body

The call returns a list of locked labels

##### Example

```json
[
    102,
    103,
    104,
    105,
    106,
    107,
    108,
    109,
    110,
    111
